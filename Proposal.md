# Proposal for Matt and Lathe's Blackjack Game
## Project Description and Motivation:
This is the classic card game "Blackjack" that we will be writing in Python. However, there will be multiple differences in ours and other Blackjack games. Firstly, we will have four different tables in the game, allowing the player to interact with different dealers who follow different AI and betting rules. Stakes vary from table to table, hence changing the difficulty for the player. We are doing this project to not only to show off our skills with Python, but also because we are both passionate about game development. 

## Prior Art:
The game, as the name implies, is based on the French casino game "Blackjack", called "21" in the 1700's. The fundementals are simple: the player must attempt to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21. Each card has a different value: Aces can either be treated as a value of 1 or 11 by the player, Face Cards are worth 10, and any other card is its printed value. The player is dealt 2 cards, with the option of "hitting" for more. When the player "stands", the dealer's cards and their cards are compared, and the one with the highest hand value that is not over 21 wins. Our additions will be based on the premise of simulating a casino, similar to prior card games. However, our game will feature multiple dealers, each with varying factors that make their tables harder or easier.

## Core User Workflows:
As described above, our program will simulate the casino game Blackjack, with a few additions. Firstly, when the program is booted, the user will be explained their goal: to turn 100 dollars into 1000 dollars. Next, they will prompted to choose what table they want to play at: Billy's, Karen's, Lathe's, or Matt's. Billy is a lack-luster dealer who has a low buy-in at his table. Karen is a snobish dealer with a moderate buy-in at her table. Lathe is an expert dealer with a high buy-in at his table. Matt is a master Blackjack player with a full 100 dollar buy-in. Once the table is chosen, and it is determined they have enough money to play at the table, the game cycle begins: to place a bet or leave the table. Once they place a bet, the player is dealt 2 cards, and the dealer gives themselves two cards. The player can either hit or stand, and if they bust, they lose that hand. Afterwards, the dealer makes their choices. Finally, the two compare hands, and the winner is given the pot, or in the case of the tie, both the player and dealer are given back their bets. The player can continue to play with the same dealer, or leave and choose a different dealer. Once the player has earned 1000 dollars, they can either leave the casino or continue playing without a set goal. With our additions and the basics of Blackjack, it should be an enjoyable experience.

## Tuesday-Thursday Daily Goals:
### *Tuesday:*
The goal for Tuesday is the get the core mechanic of the game working: playing Blackjack. This will encompass a basic loop for the player and dealer to hit for cards, then compare their hands. This will also involve setting up data structures for the deck and the cards themselves, and shuffling the deck.
### *Wednesday:*
The goal for Wednesday is to integrate betting and different tables into the game. This will also include making the different dealers better or worse at the game, and giving them some dialogue. This will have more emphasis on getting to the goal of turning 100 into 1000.
### *Thursday:*
The goal for Thursday is to finalize the game. This includes "closing" the game loop, allowing for a full playthrough of the game. This will also include testing the game and probing for bugs, and possibly adding more visual elements.
